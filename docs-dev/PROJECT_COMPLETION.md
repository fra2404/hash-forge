# Hash Forge - Project Completion Summary

## üéâ Project Successfully Completed!

Hash Forge is now a fully functional, professional-grade hash generator and verifier written in Rust with both CLI and GUI interfaces.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### Core Implementation

- **Complete CLI Interface**: Built with `clap` for professional command-line usage
- **Modern GUI Interface**: Built with `egui`/`eframe` for intuitive graphical usage
- **Comprehensive Algorithm Support**: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, BLAKE2b/s, BLAKE3, bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Text input, file hashing, batch directory processing
- **Hash Verification**: Verify hashes against expected values with proper error handling
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Hexadecimal and Base64 encoding

### Architecture & Code Quality

- **Clean Architecture**: Modular design with separated CLI, GUI, and core logic
- **Dual Binary Structure**: Separate binaries for CLI (`hash-forge`) and GUI (`hash-forge-gui`)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with `anyhow` and `thiserror`
- **Cross-platform**: Full support for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Performance Optimized**: Progress bars for large files, efficient algorithms
- **Security Focus**: Constant-time comparisons, proper salt handling

### Testing & Validation

- **Unit Tests**: Core functionality tested
- **Integration Tests**: CLI commands thoroughly tested
- **Real-world Usage**: All algorithms and features working correctly
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety
- **Cross-compilation Ready**: Prepared for multi-platform builds

## üöÄ Key Features Demonstrated

### CLI Usage Examples

```bash
# Text hashing with various algorithms
./target/release/hash-forge text --input "Hello, World!" --algorithm sha256
./target/release/hash-forge text --input "password" --algorithm bcrypt

# File hashing
./target/release/hash-forge file --path document.pdf --algorithm blake3

# Hash verification
./target/release/hash-forge verify --text "test" --algorithm sha256 --expected-hash 9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08

# Batch processing
./target/release/hash-forge batch --directory ./files --algorithm sha256
```
