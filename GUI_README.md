# 🎨 Hash Forge GUI - Phase 1 Enhanced

## ✨ What's New

Hash Forge GUI has been completely enhanced with all Phase 1 features:

### 🔑 New: HMAC Authentication Mode
- Toggle between Hash Mode and HMAC Mode
- Secure key input with password field
- Support for HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA512, HMAC-SHA3-*
- HMAC verification functionality

### 📋 New: Algorithm Categories
- **Modern**: BLAKE3, SHA-3, xxHash3, Argon2 ⭐
- **Fast Hash**: All non-password algorithms
- **Password Hash**: Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt 🔒  
- **Legacy**: MD5, SHA-1, older xxHash ⚠️

### 🆕 New Algorithms (19 total)
- **SHA-3 Family**: SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512
- **SHAKE Functions**: SHAKE128, SHAKE256 (extendable output)
- **xxHash Family**: xxHash32, xxHash64, xxHash3 (ultra-fast)

### 🎨 Enhanced User Interface
- **Professional dark theme** with modern styling
- **Color-coded algorithms** with emoji indicators
- **Real-time performance metrics** (time, speed, file size)
- **Enhanced verification** with clear visual feedback
- **Responsive design** with scroll areas
- **Monospace display** for hash results

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Launch enhanced GUI
./target/release/hash-forge-gui

# Or build and run
cargo run --bin hash-forge-gui
```

## 🎯 Key Features

1. **HMAC Mode**: Toggle to enable message authentication
2. **Smart Categories**: Filter algorithms by use case
3. **Visual Indicators**: ⭐ recommended, 🔒 password, ⚠️ legacy
4. **Performance Metrics**: Real-time speed calculations
5. **Dual Verification**: Both hash and HMAC verification
6. **Modern Design**: Professional dark theme

## 📊 Algorithm Categories

| Category | Algorithms | Use Case |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Modern ⭐ | BLAKE3, SHA-3, xxHash3, Argon2 | Recommended for new projects |
| Fast Hash | SHA-256, BLAKE2, SHA-3, xxHash | File integrity, general purpose |
| Password 🔒 | Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt | Password hashing only |
| Legacy ⚠️ | MD5, SHA-1, xxHash32/64 | Compatibility only |

## 🔑 HMAC Workflow

1. Toggle "🔑 HMAC Mode"
2. Enter secret key (secure input)
3. Select SHA-based algorithm
4. Enter message text
5. Compute HMAC
6. Optional: Verify against expected HMAC

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

- **Dark Theme**: Professional appearance
- **Rich Typography**: Clear hierarchy and spacing
- **Color Coding**: Green (success), Red (error), Yellow (warning)
- **Emoji Indicators**: Quick visual algorithm identification
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on different screen sizes

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
./test_gui_phase1.sh
```

This tests all new algorithms in CLI and provides checklist for GUI testing.

## 📝 Notes

- HMAC mode only supports SHA-based algorithms
- File HMAC computation available in CLI, GUI support coming soon
- All Phase 1 features work in both CLI and GUI
- Performance metrics show real processing speeds

---

**Phase 1 Complete!** 🎉 All new cryptographic algorithms and HMAC functionality are now available in both CLI and enhanced GUI interfaces.
